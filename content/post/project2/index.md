abstract: Applied Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm in the Gatech [Robotarium](https://www.robotarium.gatech.edu/) multi-robot simulation environment to enable the robots to achieve fixed locations while avoiding collision with other robots. Applied Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) in the OpenAI Multi-agent environment to perform formation control(making the robots form a given shape)
# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Applied Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm in the Gatech [Robotarium](https://www.robotarium.gatech.edu/) multi-robot simulation environment, and Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) in OpenAI gym to achieve formation control.
