# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We use Teris environment to simulate the Space Saving problem, where we have to fill out most of the room of a given space using randomly-created shape of blocks. In this project, we applied Deep Q-Learning to determine where the blocks should be placed. [**Video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMpeunFLy4)
